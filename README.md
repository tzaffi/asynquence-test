# asynquence-test
Playing around with Kyle Simpson's callback hell killer nirvana library

## `ASQ.js`
This is basically most of the code in Appendix A of Kyle Simposon's [Async & Performance](http://www.amazon.com/You-Dont-Know-JS-Performance/dp/1491904224)                                       

## `zASQ.js`
Me just playing around trying to figure out what it all means

## `callback.js`
Standard callback approch

### TODO:
translate `callback.js` into **ASQ**!!!
